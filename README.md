ASG1- Music Visualization with particle systems
Circles fall to the bottom of the screen as thunder crackles and rain hits the floor. Watch the size of the "droplets" get bigger as the music gets louder. I used the FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) to visualize how audio such as a thunder sound can be used to effect particle systems implemented using P5(Construct). Once a particle gets to the bottom of the screen it "dies" and respawns at the top.
