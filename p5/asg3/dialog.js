//dialog.js
/*a DialogBox class  with the necessary properties and methods
 to draw an interactive dialog box on the screen with text and/or
  shapes within the boundaries of the box.
This class should support affirmative sentences as well as questions
 with yes/no answers.  To answer a question, the player should press "y" or "n".
All the text and/or shapes drawn are assumed to fit on this dialog 
box, so you don't have  to implement scrolling or paging.
